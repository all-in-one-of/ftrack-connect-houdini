Publishing asset versions
*************************

Use the publish asset dialog to publish a new asset version from Houdini.

For now supported asset types are:

* Scene
* Geometry
* Camera

To publish a new asset or version up an existing, simply select it in your scene
and bring up the publish asset dialog from the ftrack menu. Select the task you
want to publish to and the type of asset you want to publish. You also need to
give the asset a unique name or select the name of an existing asset to version
up. A thumbnail can be added manually or as a screenshot of the current
viewport.
